# 3d-spining-ascii-donut
This project is a C++ implementation of a mesmerizing ASCII-art spinning 3D torus. It uses mathematical functions like sine and cosine to calculate the torus' shape and luminance. The code employs a z-buffer algorithm for depth management, ensuring accurate rendering of the torus' perspective. Real-time updates create smooth animation.
