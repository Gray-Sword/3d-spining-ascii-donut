# ASCII Spinning 3D Torus

This project is a mesmerizing ASCII-art visualization of a spinning 3D torus, created using C++. The program renders a smooth, animated 3D effect directly in the console, employing trigonometric functions and depth-buffering techniques for accurate and visually appealing results.

## Features

- **Real-Time Animation:** The torus spins smoothly and continuously.
- **Luminance Shading:** Dynamic shading enhances the 3D effect using ASCII characters.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Implements a z-buffer for realistic depth calculations.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs directly in the console on any operating system.

## How It Works

1. **Mathematical Rendering:** 
   - Trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`) generate the torus' 3D coordinates.
   - Rotation matrices simulate movement.

2. **Luminance Calculation:** 
   - Computes light intensity at each point using normals and a light source.

3. **Depth Buffering:** 
   - Ensures the correct parts of the torus are visible by managing depth values.

4. **ASCII Output:** 
   - Maps luminance to a gradient of ASCII characters (`.,-~:;=!*#$@`).

## Requirements

- **Compiler:** A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or newer.
- **Operating System:** Any system with a text-based console (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
